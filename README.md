## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have learned to reduce more code than usual, for me this has been a great challenge, but I still liked seeing my style more organized.

At first I decided to support myself with HTML5 to make a horizontal line, but I wanted to challenge myself with CSS3:

```css
.line {
    content: '';
    width: 100%;
    border: 1px solid rgb(224, 222, 222);
}
```
### Continued development

The challenges have helped me to progress a lot with CSS, since many properties that can be found in CSS remain a mystery to me and little by little I am organizing ideas and improving based on style. I like to challenge myself, I feel like every time I learn something new without realizing it and when I check my code I can see the progress :D
